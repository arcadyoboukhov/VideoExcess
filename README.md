# VideoExcess

) 
VideoExcess is a video player made for large amounts of mp3 and mp4 files. It differs from the other video players in that it saves the current position (time in video) in a JSON file.  It makes a percentage of the completion of mp4/mp3 in a folder (say you watched 10 videos out of 100 it would say 10%). IT DOES NOT SHOW PERCENTAGE COMPLETE FOR SINGLE FILE CORRECTLY, maybe in an update. It auto-creates a JSON file for every mp3/mp4 or reads an existing one,  you can move the file to any computer and this program would work. 

## Features

- ✅ JSON file for each Mp4/mp3 - It is used to calculate the percentage of videos completed and play the video from the position you left off. 
- ✅ Folder support - You can use full folders of mp4/mp3 files. This is made to work well with the percentage complete system.
